<p align='center'> <big> ðŸ“°Explaination <p>
<p align='center'> This is a program that makes it possible to log in and then specify a file that ends with ".txt" and then you can add a text and then it searches through the entire file for the "text" that you gave up!  </p>
 <p align='center'> You have to put the text file in the same file as the executable called "Notepad.exe" you can find it [Here](https://github.com/NotCrypto/File-Lookup/tree/main/bin/Debug) </p>
 <p align='center'>PS: If you want to edit the program ask me for permission. Are you in trouble? "N-O-T C R Y P T O # 7589" </p>
