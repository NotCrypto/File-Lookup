# File-Lookup
 
This is a program that makes it possible to log in and then specify a file that ends with ".txt" and then and then you can add a text and then it searches through the entire file for the "text" that you gave up!
 You have to put the text file in the same file as the executable called "Notepad.exe" you can find it in [Path]((https://github.com/NotCrypto/File-Lookup/tree/main/bin/Debug) in the folder 
 PS: You have to build it in "Visual Studio 2019"  Are you in trouble? "N-O-T C R Y P T O # 7589"
